CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


# Architecture
**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**

Utilizing Java on frontend and backend development made the website very dynamic. Utilizing this to pull data from the MongoDB website is a great way to create a user-friendly site. 


**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

Utilizing a NoSQL MongoDB database was due to the ease of scaling, making chages, and overall functionality of the application. 


# Functionality
**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**

JSON formats object data and is easy to read with Java. Javascript takes data and transforms it into an object in its own language, Java. This helps with tying the frontend and backend development together. 

# Testing
**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.**

One way to test a website is to visit the site itself and inspect the element through browser tools. This is a great way to detect any active errors. Utilizing Postman for testing inputs is another great way to test and is also secure. 

**Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

Methods such as "GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE" are http requests to change, look, or develop the functionality of the database. For the backend, we use functions such as "create, find, findOne, and findOneAndUpdate" to alter the database based on the client's needs. 

Endpoints are tested often to ensure funcionality and to ensure everything is running as intended.

Security is added to prevent unwanted or unauthorized entry of users attempting to access or change the database.

# Reflection
**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

Any coding course I take I consider to be a huge step towards my end goal. I think I have learned valuable information about NoSQL databases, and MEAN stack which is what I was most looking forward to. It was a rewarding experience each week to add to code and see the website transform as I modify different bits. I will carry the knowledge gained from this course into the next and build onto my skillset for the future.
